				Can the Earth Be Saved ?
			</p>
			<p class="smalltext">
				New science shows a clear path we must take to prevent irreversible damage to the lands, waters that sustain us all. It's not too late to choose a more sustainable future where nature and people thrive together. To reach it, we must transform the way we get our food, fish and energy right now. In recent, published research from The Nature Conservancy and 12 peer organizations, science points us to a better path for building a more sustainable, more hopeful future for the Earth.

	<p class="sectiontag bigtext">Produce More Food on Less Land</p>
	<p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Today's version of large-scale agriculture is the biggest source of land conversion, drives deforestation that worsens climate change, uses 70 percent of the world’s freshwater supply and relies on fertilizer practices that pollute our waters. As the need to feed a billion more people increases, agricultural expansion could devastate habitats, release even more carbon into the atmosphere, and dry up rivers.We’re analyzing satellite images and local yield potential to pinpoint where soy farming and cattle ranching can expand without destroying nature. This approach is especially vital in Brazil’s Cerrado region, where half of all natural habitat has already been converted to cropland and pasture. Cooperating with farmers on sustainable practices can help save what’s left of the Cerrado’s rich savanna.  </p></div>

	<p class="sectiontag bigtext"> Eliminate Overfishing</p>
	<p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Overfishing and poor fisheries management is not only devastating to the fish species being pushed to the brink of collapse. It endangers food webs and ocean ecosystems by disrupting the balance of all sea life. And it threatens billions of people who rely on seafood as an important source of livelihood and animal protein. Without serious changes, 84 percent of the world’s fish stocks will be in peril in our lifetime. We’re making it fast, easy and affordable for fishers to use data to manage their catches more sustainably. Like image recognition software, FishFace technology we’re pioneering in Indonesia uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify fish species and track their numbers so fishers can avoid catching too many or the wrong kind.</p></div>

	<p class="sectiontag bigtext"> Increase Clean Energy</p>
	<p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Climate change is the single most serious threat facing our planet today. We must reduce carbon emissions to, or below, levels agreed to in the Paris Climate Agreement to prevent catastrophic harm. And with global energy demand expected to increase 56 percent over the next couple decades, it will be impossible to meet those emissions targets if we stick primarily with traditional fossil fuels. 
How we’re taking action right now:
We’re championing regulations that allow former mining lands to be repurposed for solar and wind energy. Tens of thousands of acres of degraded mine sites in Nevada’s Great Basin are now available for renewable energy development. By targeting already-disturbed land, new turbines and solar panels won’t need to destroy more natural habitat </p></div>
